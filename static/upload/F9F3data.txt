leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines-2|script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy-2|just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for 2 minutes-2|Who was this movie made for anyway?Oh, and the special effects are laughable-2|just a poor representation of the cartoon-2|one will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and no care whatsoever was put into it-2|Keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent INSANE amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter-2|such a great actor-1|but I thought that was really sweet-1|I would strongly recommend to watch this movie-1
